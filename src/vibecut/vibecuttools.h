/** @brief Native-mode tool surface exposed to the assistant.
 *
 * Modelled on vibecad's per-tool service contract: each tool has a JSON
 * Schema spec (name, description, input_schema) and a handler that returns
 * `{"ok": bool, ...}` — on failure `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`.
 *
 * The goal is for the chat panel to be able to drive Kdenlive the way
 * Windsurf/Claude Code drive a codebase — broad real capability, not a
 * narrow menu bolted on one button at a time. Concretely: tools call
 * Kdenlive's own internal operations directly (including things like its own
 * Python/pip installer for optional features, see the speech_* tools) rather
 * than pointing the user at a Settings dialog. That's a different boundary
 * than a raw "run any shell command" bridge, which stays out of scope here
 * (that escape hatch belongs to VibeScript, not Native mode) — but within
 * "things Kdenlive itself can already do," the tool surface should grow
 * freely rather than being gatekept per capability.
 *
 * All handlers run on the GUI thread (the agent marshals calls here), so they
 * may touch pCore / the timeline model directly.
